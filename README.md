# Fibonacci
Fibonacci numbers exists when each is the sum of the previous 2 numbers:
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
the first 12 terms are: 
F1 = 1
F2 = 1
F3 = 2
F4 = 3
F5 = 5
F6 = 8
F7 = 13
F8 = 21
F9 = 34
F10 = 55
F11 = 89
F12 = 144
The F12 term sits on the 12th index and is the first 3 digit sum.
What index yields the 1st term to contain a 1,000 digit sum?

# npm run fib


# Counting summations
There are 6 ways to reach a sum of 5:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1
3 + 2
4 + 1
How many ways exist to reach a sum of 100 using 2 or more positive integers

# npm run sum
